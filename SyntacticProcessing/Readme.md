•	Written the vanilla Viterbi algorithm for assigning POS tags (i.e. without dealing with unknown words) 
•	Solving the problem of unknown words using at least two techniques. These techniques can use any of the approaches discussed in the class - lexicon, rule-based, probabilistic etc. 
•	Comparing the tagging accuracy after making these modifications with the vanilla Viterbi algorithm.
