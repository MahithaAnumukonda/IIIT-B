An Indian startup named 'Foodie' wants to build a conversational bot (chatbot) which can help users discover restaurants across several Indian cities. The main purpose of the bot is to help users discover restaurants quickly and efficiently and to provide a good restaurant discovery experience. The bot takes the following inputs from the user: City, Cuisine Preference & price range
While showing the results to the user, the bot should display the top 5 restaurants in a sorted order (descending) of the average Zomato user rating (on a scale of 1-5, 5 being the highest). 
Finally, the bot should ask the user whether he/she wants the details of the top 10 restaurants on email. If the user replies 'yes', the bot should ask for userâ€™s email id and then send it over email. Else, just reply with a 'goodbye' message.
